# Weather events: harm & cost
_**Analysis of economic and human costs using NOAA storm data, years 1980-2011**_

**Synopsis**

This analysis aims to answer the following questions:

- Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

- Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

## Data processing

The following code:

- loads packages for data manipulation and display
- reads in data
- reformats date
- adds a `year` column
- sorts by date 
- combines weather event types that can be grouped for the purposes of this analysis
- excludes years before 1980 due to thin record keeping

### Data format

An **Event** is an individual type of storm event. (Thunderstorm Wind, Hail, Tornado and
Flood are events.) Each row of the data represents an event, and the event type is specified in the `EVTYPE` variable.

An **Episode** is an entire storm system and can contain many different types of events.

Episodes are treated as events in the data. Episode narratives are recorded in REMARKS column, as are some event narratives. The structure of the data, however, does not include a formal tie between individual events to the episodes they are a part of.

## Results
Consider the figure below for baseline weather event frequency (as recorded in the data). These frequencies affect both deaths and economic costs inflicted by each event type as explored in the subsections below.  

```{r frequent-events}
# summarize event type by count
event_count <- group_by(storm, EVTYPE) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# plot weather events occurring more than 3800 times after 1980
event_count %>% 
  filter(count >= 4000) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(forcats::fct_reorder(EVTYPE, count, .desc = TRUE), count)) +
# Vertical x labels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .5))+
  labs(title = "Most frequent weather events",
       subtitle = "Events occurring more than 4000 times during the period",
    x = "Event type",
    y = "Event count"
  )
```

### Human cost — deaths and injuries

```{r deaths-and-injuries}
# Set up variables for analysis of deaths and injuries

# summarize event type by count
# calculate deaths & injuries per event
casualties_per_event <- group_by(storm, EVTYPE) %>%
  summarize(deaths = sum(FATALITIES),
            injuries = sum(INJURIES),
            count = n()
            ) %>%
  # arrange(desc(deaths), desc(count)) %>% # This shouldn't change anything
  # calculate casualty rates
  mutate(
         deaths_per_event = round(deaths / count, digits = 5),
         injuries_per_event = round(injuries / count, digits = 5),
         casualties_per_event = deaths_per_event + injuries_per_event
         ) %>%
  arrange(desc(deaths)) %>%
  select(EVTYPE,
         deaths,
         injuries,
         count,
         deaths_per_event,
         injuries_per_event,
         everything()
         )
```
  
This look at casualties by events shows wind, flood and extreme temperature events are particularly hazardous.

```{r top-deaths, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}

# Prep for stacked bar plot
stack_data_human <- casualties_per_event %>% 
  filter(deaths >= 5 | count >= 5 | injuries >= 20) %>%    #  Exclude infrequent events
  mutate(cumulative_deaths = cumsum(deaths),
           cumulative_injuries = cumsum(injuries),
           cumulative_casualties = cumulative_deaths + cumulative_injuries) %>%
  # filter small causes of death below threshold
    filter(cumulative_deaths <= threshold) %>%
  select(deaths,
         injuries,
         cumulative_deaths,
         cumulative_injuries,
         cumulative_casualties,
         count,
         everything()
         ) %>%
  rename(death = deaths, injury = injuries)

  # Order by deaths

         casualty_count,

         cumulative_injuries,
         cumulative_casualties,
         everything(),
         -count
         ) %>%
    arrange(EVTYPE)

# make casualty type a factor
stack_data_human$casualty_type <- as.factor(stack_data_human$casualty_type)

# reverse factor level order for casualty type (deaths as bottom of stacked bars)
stack_data_human$casualty_type <- factor(stack_data_human$casualty_type,
                                         levels=rev(levels(stack_data_human$casualty_type)))

## Topics for further exploration

This analysis is intended to give an overview of the costs of weather events nationwide. Further analysis could focus on differences over time or by geographic region.

### Costs over time

It might be valuable to evaluate economic and human costs per weather event over time with the goal of identifying effective and ineffective interventions as well as growing weather-related dangers.

Such an analysis would be difficult with this data set, as the number and type of weather events recorded grows each year. Some incidents may appear to spike where record keeping merely improved. More intimate knowledge of the history of weather measurement & recording techniques might help account for this issue. Further analysis might focus on a single metric or subset of metrics that have been recorded in the same way for a sufficient number of years. Another alternative would be to use a more consistent source of weather data.

Any analysis of costs over time should also be scaled to the change in population or industry size (scale of agricultural output, for example).

### Regional analysis

This analysis has been a cursory overview of the costs of weather events at a national level. More granular analysis could drill down by region, state or county. It may be beneficial to set regional priorities by focusing on the costliest or most frequent types of events by area. Code herein can be adapted to regional data by subsetting the input to the region in question.
