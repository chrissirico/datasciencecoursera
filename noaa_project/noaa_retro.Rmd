# Weather events: harm & cost
_**Analysis of economic and human costs using NOAA storm data, years 1980-2011**_

This analysis aims to answer the following questions:

- Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

- Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

## Data processing

The following code:

- loads packages for data manipulation and display
- reads in data
- reformats date
- adds a `year` column
- sorts by date 
- combines weather event types that can be grouped for the purposes of this analysis
- excludes years before 1980 due to thin record keeping

### Data format

An **Event** is an individual type of storm event. (Thunderstorm Wind, Hail, Tornado and
Flood are events.) Each row of the data represents an event, and the event type is specified in the `EVTYPE` variable.

An **Episode** is an entire storm system and can contain many different types of events.

Episodes are treated as events in the data. Episode narratives are recorded in REMARKS column, as are some event narratives. The structure of the data, however, does not include a formal tie between individual events to the episodes they are a part of.

## Results
Consider the figure below for baseline weather event frequency (as recorded in the data). These frequencies affect both deaths and economic costs inflicted by each event type as explored in the subsections below.  

```{r frequent-events}
# summarize event type by count
event_count <- group_by(storm, EVTYPE) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# plot weather events occurring more than 3800 times after 1980
event_count %>% 
  filter(count >= 4000) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(forcats::fct_reorder(EVTYPE, count, .desc = TRUE), count)) +
# Vertical x labels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .5))+
  labs(title = "Most frequent weather events",
       subtitle = "Events occurring more than 4000 times during the period",
    x = "Event type",
    y = "Event count"
  )
```

### Human cost — deaths and injuries

```{r deaths-and-counts}
# Set up variables for analysis of deaths and counts

# summarize event type by count
event_count <- group_by(storm, EVTYPE) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# group by event type and count fatalities
event_deaths <- group_by(storm, EVTYPE) %>%
  summarise(deaths = sum(FATALITIES)) %>%
  arrange(desc(deaths))

# JOIN deaths and counts by event type
deaths_and_counts <- left_join(event_deaths, event_count) %>%
  arrange(desc(deaths), desc(count))

# calculate deaths per event
deaths_per_event <- deaths_and_counts %>%
  mutate(avg_deaths_per_event = round(deaths / count, digits = 5)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_deaths_per_event)) %>%
  select(EVTYPE, avg_deaths_per_event, everything())

# Set up variables for analysis of injuries and counts

# group by event type and count injuries
event_injuries <- group_by(storm, EVTYPE) %>%
  summarise(injuries = sum(INJURIES)) %>%
  arrange(desc(injuries))

# JOIN injuries and counts by event type
injuries_and_counts <- left_join(event_injuries, event_count) %>%
   arrange(desc(injuries), desc(count))

# calculate injuries per event
injuries_per_event <- injuries_and_counts %>%
  mutate(avg_injuries_per_event = round(injuries / count, digits = 5)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_injuries_per_event)) %>%
  select(EVTYPE, avg_injuries_per_event, everything())

# All these variables are superfluous, really
injuries_and_deaths <- full_join(injuries_and_counts, deaths_and_counts)

# I should skip to these
injuries_and_deaths_per_event <- right_join(injuries_per_event, deaths_per_event) %>%
  filter(deaths >= 5 | count >= 5) #Exclude infrequent events

# Gather for stacked bar plot
stack_data_human <- injuries_and_deaths_per_event %>% 
  # arrange(EVTYPE) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_deaths = cumsum(deaths),
           cumulative_injuries = cumsum(injuries),
           cumulative_casualties = cumulative_deaths + cumulative_injuries) %>%
    filter(cumulative_deaths <= .95*sum(injuries_and_deaths_per_event$deaths)) %>% 
  select(deaths, injuries, cumulative_deaths, cumulative_injuries, cumulative_casualties, count, everything()) %>% View()
  rename(death = deaths, injury = injuries) %>% 
  # Gather deaths and injuries
  gather(key = casualty_type, value = casualty_count, death, injury) %>%
  select(casualty_type, casualty_count, cumulative_deaths, cumulative_injuries, cumulative_casualties, everything(), -count) %>%
    arrange(EVTYPE)
# reverse factor order for casualty type
stack_data_human$casualty_type <- sizes <- factor(stack_data_human$casualty_type, levels=rev(levels(stack_data_human$casualty_type))) 
```

#### Deaths by event type

```{r deadliness, include=FALSE}
# leaving this out because it's redundant and hard to read

# filter infrequent and less-dangerous event types
deaths_per_event %>%
  filter(deaths > 5 & count > 5) %>%
  filter(deaths > 7 & (count >= 5000 | avg_deaths_per_event >= .5)) %>%

ggplot(aes(x = count, y = avg_deaths_per_event)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = deaths > 500)) +
  scale_x_sqrt(breaks = c(100, 1000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 200000, 300000)) +
  scale_y_sqrt(breaks = c(.001, .005, .01, .05, .1, .5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20)) +
  labs(
    title = "Deadliness and frequency of events",
    subtitle = "(Square root scale)",
    x = "Count",
    y = "Deaths / event occurence"
      ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    aes(label = EVTYPE),
    fontface = 'bold',
    box.padding = 0.35, point.padding = 0.5,
    segment.color = 'grey50',
    size = 3
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 16) +
  theme(
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .5),
        text = element_text(size=12)
        ) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("blue", "red"))
```

The deadliest types of weather events are:  

```{r top-deaths}
# plot events accounting for 95% of casualties

# make this a stacked bar plot with injuries below
# data will probably have to look like this:

# EVTYPE  casualty_type   casualty_count
# tornado injury          123456
# tornado death           7890

stack_data_human %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(
    x = forcats::fct_reorder(EVTYPE, casualty_count, .desc = TRUE),
    y = casualty_count
    # fill = casualty_type
    )) +
  # Vertical x labels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .5)) +
  labs(
       title = "Tornadoes, heat and floods cause most weather deaths",
       subtitle = "Categories shown below account for ~95% of weather-related deaths 1980-2011",
       x = "Event type",
       y = "Deaths"
      )
```
  
Here's a list of the average number of deaths per event for weather events with more than four occurences. Sorted descending by deaths per event:

Sorted descending by total deaths in time period 1980-2011:  

```{r rip-percent}
# total rip current casualties
rip_currents <- filter(storm, EVTYPE == "RIP CURRENT") %>%
  mutate(casualties = FATALITIES + INJURIES) %>%
  arrange(casualties, BGN_DATE) %>%
  select(BGN_DATE, casualties, FATALITIES, INJURIES, REMARKS)
  
# calculate proportion of recorded rip currents with exactly 1 casualty (injury or death)
rip_ones_percent <- filter(rip_currents, casualties == 1) %>%
  summarize(nrow = n()) 
rip_ones_percent <- rip_ones_percent[[1,1]]/nrow(rip_currents)
```

Note that `RIP CURRENT` has an average .78 deaths per event. This rate may be artificially high if rip currents are anecdotally reported when there is an incident. This seems to be the case because `r scales::percent(rip_ones_percent)` of recorded rip currents have exactly 1 injury or death. Nearly all recorded rip currents have remarks, most of which mention counts of lifeguard rescues.

The same seems to be true of lightning strikes as well.

#### Injuries by event type 

Let's look at a similar set of lists for numbers of injuries per event.



### Economic loss — property damage & crop loss

```{r costs-and-counts}
# Set up variables for analysis of economic costs and counts
```

#### Property damage by event type

The most economically costly types of weather events are:
```{r}
# group by event type
# sum property and crop damage
```

#### Crop loss by event type



## Topics for further exploration

This analysis is intended to give an overview of the costs of weather events nationwide. Further analysis could focus on differences over time or by geographic region.

### Costs over time

It might be valuable to evaluate economic and human costs per weather event over time with the goal of identifying effective and ineffective interventions as well as growing weather-related dangers.

Such an analysis would be difficult with this data set, as the number and type of weather events recorded grows each year. Some incidents may appear to spike where record keeping merely improved. More intimate knowledge of the history of weather measurement & recording techniques might help account for this issue. Further analysis might focus on a single metric or subset of metrics that have been recorded in the same way for a sufficient number of years. Another alternative would be to use a more consistent source of weather data.

Any analysis of costs over time should also be scaled to the change in population or industry size (scale of agricultural output, for example).

### Regional analysis

This analysis has been a cursory overview of the costs of weather events at a national level. More granular analysis could drill down by region, state or county. It may be beneficial to set regional priorities by focusing on the costliest or most frequent types of events by area.
